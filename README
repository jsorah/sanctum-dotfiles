Personal repository of independent dotfiles.

This is for all my personal configuration files that migrate well from machine
to machine.

Then it's a matter of loading git submodules, deleting stock files and
symlinking everything in, which can be done with the included "dotfiles"
script:

$ bash .dotfiles/install.sh
