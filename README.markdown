Dotfiles
========

Tom Ryder's personal repository of dotfiles. This is for those settings that
migrate well from machine to machine and that I consider safe to publish.
You're welcome to use them, but you'll probably want to fork it to remove
anything peculiar to me or my setup that I've left in here.

    $ git clone git://github.com/tejr/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

There's an installation script, but it's pretty bare-bones, so don't run it
without reading it first. You'll also need to have a recent enough version of
Git to support [submodules][1].

    $ ~/.dotfiles/install
