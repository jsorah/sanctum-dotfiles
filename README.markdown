Dotfiles
========

Tom Ryder's personal repository of dotfiles. This is for those settings that
migrate well from machine to machine and that I consider safe to publish.

These are not really built for other people to use, but if you know a thing or
two about Bash and Vim, you won't struggle.

    $ cd 
    $ git clone git://github.com/tejr/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

There's an installation script, but it's pretty bare-bones and might delete
files you already have in place, so don't run it without reading it first.
You'll also need to have a recent enough version of Git to support
[submodules][1].

    $ .dotfiles/install
