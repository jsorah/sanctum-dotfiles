.SH NAME
.B maybe
\- possibly exit with success
.SH USAGE
.B maybe [-hv] [-d DENOMINATOR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Like true(1) or false(1), but exits with success randomly with a given
probability. Good for using in tests. Exits with 2 rather than 1 on usage
errors.
.P
This just uses integer division with Bash's special RANDOM variable, so it's
far from scientific precision.
.P
Option -h gives help, option -v turns on verbose output, option -d specifies
the denominator for the probability; defaults to 2 (i.e. roughly equal chance
of success or failure).
.P
   $ maybe
   $ maybe -v -d3
.SH SEE ALSO
true(1), false(1), try(1)
