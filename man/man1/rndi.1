\- return a low-quality random integer between two bounds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rndi
0 10
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rndi
returns a random integer ranging from the first argument to the second argument
in a POSIX-compliant way (using awk). The answer returned is low-quality and if
run in the same second as a previous run may even return the same result in
some implementations. This should not be used in any sort of security or
statistical context; the author wrote it to choose random background images.
