.SH NAME
.B rndi
\- return a low-quality random integer between two bounds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rndi
0 10
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rndi
returns a random integer ranging from the first argument to the second argument
in a POSIX-compliant way (using awk).
.P
The answer returned is low-quality; given some implementations of awk, it may
even return the same result if run within the same second. This should not be
used in any sort of security or statistical context. The author wrote it to
support scripts to choose a random background image from a directory.
