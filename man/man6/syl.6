.SH DESCRIPTION
.B syl
applies some very crude heuristics to guess at the number of syllables that
would be used if the Latin-alphabet word on the command line were spoken out
loud. It is far too inaccurate for any serious use, particularly for languages
other than English; the author uses it for poetry generation.
