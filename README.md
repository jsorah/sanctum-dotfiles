Dotfiles
========

Tom Ryder's personal repository of dotfiles. This is for those settings that migrate well from machine to machine and that I consider safe to publish.

These are not really built for other people to use, but if you know a thing or two about Bash and Vim, you won't struggle.

    $ cd
    $ git clone git://github.com/tejr/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

There's an installation script, but it hoses your existing files, so don't run it without reading it first. You'll also need to have a recent enough version of Git to support [submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).

    $ .dotfiles/install.sh
