*strip_trailing_whitespace.txt*	For Vim version 7.0	Last change: 2017 November 12

DESCRIPTION				*strip_trailing_whitespace*

This plugin provides a mapping target and an optional custom command with the
author's approach to stripping trailing whitespace from an entire buffer,
including removing empty or whitespace-only lines at the end of the buffer,
without making command noise and without moving the cursor from its current
position.

REQUIREMENTS				*strip_trailing_whitespace-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

COMMANDS				*strip_trailing_whitespace-commands*

					*:StripTrailingWhitespace*
The plugin provides a single `:StripTrailingWhitespace` command if Vim has the
|+user_commands| feature, but this is not required. It operates on the entire
buffer, and accepts neither a range nor arguments.

MAPPINGS				*strip_trailing_whitespace-mappings*

					*<Plug>StripTrailingWhitespace*
The single mapping target provided is |<Plug>StripTrailingWhitespace|,
mappable in any mode. There is no default key mapping to the target; you
should define this yourself in your |vimrc|. For example:
>
	:nmap <Leader>x <Plug>StripTrailingWhitespace>

AUTHOR					*strip_trailing_whitespace-author*

Written and maintained by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>.

LICENSE					*strip_trailing_whitespace-license*

Licensed for distribution under the same terms as Vim itself (see |license|).

DISTRIBUTION				*strip_trailing_whitespace-distribution*

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and may eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves. See <https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/dotfiles.git/about/> for more
information.
