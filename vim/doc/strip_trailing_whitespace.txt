*strip_trailing_whitespace.txt*  Strip trailing whitespace from whole buffer

This plugin is the author's approach to stripping trailing whitespace from an
entire buffer, including empty lines at the end, without making command noise
and without moving the cursor from its current position.

If also provides a :StripTrailingWhitespace command if you have +user_commands,
but this is not required.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
