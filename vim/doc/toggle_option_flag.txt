This plugin provides commands :ToggleOptionFlag and :ToggleOptionFlagLocal to
toggle the values of options like |'formatoptions'| or |'complete'| that have
values comprised of single-character flags. The author originally designed it
for toggling flags in |'formatoptions'| quickly.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
