*auto_swapdir.txt*  Automatically create 'swapdir' in 'realtimepath'

This plugin attempts to create a directory "swap" in the directory named by the
first element of 'realtimepath', and enables 'swapfile' with that as the
'directory' if it succeeds or if the directory already exists.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
