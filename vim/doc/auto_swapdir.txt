DESCRIPTION					*auto_swapdir*

This plugin attempts to create a directory "swap" in the directory named by
the first element of 'runtimepath', and enables 'swapfile' with that as the
'directory' if it succeeds or if the directory already exists.

REQUIREMENTS					*auto_swapdir-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

AUTHOR						*auto_swapdir-author*

Written and maintained by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>.

LICENSE						*auto_swapdir-license*

Licensed for distribution under the same terms as Vim itself (see |license|).

DISTRIBUTION					*auto_swapdir-distribution*

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and may eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves. See <https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/dotfiles.git/about/> for more
information.
