DESCRIPTION					*big_file_options*

This plugin adds an |autocmd| hook to check the file size of an incoming
buffer, and if it's over a certain threshold, disables certain options in order
to make the file a bit easier to edit.

REQUIREMENTS					*big_file_options-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

AUTHOR						*big_file_options-author*

Written and maintained by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>.

LICENSE						*big_file_options-license*

Licensed for distribution under the same terms as Vim itself (see |license|).

DISTRIBUTION					*big_file_options-distribution*

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and may eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves. See <https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/dotfiles.git/about/> for more
information.
