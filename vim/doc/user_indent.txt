*user_indent.txt*  "Undo" for local indent files

This plugin adds an |autocmd| hook to |FileType| to run before the one that the
core indent.vim sets, to allow setting a b:undo_user_indent variable with
code to |:execute| when the filetype is next changed, in much the same way that
the core files in Vim >= 7.0x support a b:|undo_indent| variable.

This will only work if it's loaded before indent.vim so that the autocmd hooks
run in the right order. There are a couple of ways to do this:

1.  Create your own ~/.vim/indent.vim with the following contents:

        silent! runtime plugin/user_indent.vim

    This will then be sourced before the core indent.vim runs. This is the
    suggested method.

2.  Run the same line in your ~/.vimrc before your `filetype indent on` line.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
