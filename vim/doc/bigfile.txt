*bigfile.txt*  Disable slow options for big files to speed things up

This plugin adds an |autocmd| hook to check the file size of an incoming
buffer, and if it's over a certain threshold, disables certain options in order
to make the file a bit easier to edit.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
