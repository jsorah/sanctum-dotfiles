*fixed_join.txt*	For Vim version 7.0	Last change: 2017 November 12

DESCRIPTION					*fixed_join*

This plugin provides a mapping target and an optional command to `:join` lines
in normal mode while keeping the cursor in-place.

REQUIREMENTS					*fixed_join-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

MAPPINGS					*fixed_join-mappings*
						*<Plug>FixedJoin*

This plugin provides a mapping target |<Plug>FixedJoin| to create a binding
for a user to `:join` lines in normal mode without the cursor jumping around.

If the user's configuration does not specify a mapping to this target by the
time this plugin is loaded, it will attempt to map 'J' in normal mode to
simply replace the default functionality.

COMMANDS					*fixed_join-commands*
						*:FixedJoin*

The plugin also provides a `:FixedJoin` command if Vim has the
|+user_commands| feature, but this is not required.

ALTERNATIVE					*fixed-join-alternative*

If you don't mind clobbering a mark, this whole plugin can be replaced with
one mapping in your |vimrc|:
>
    :nnoremap J mzJ`z
<
This was what the author was doing before writing this plugin as an exercise.

AUTHOR						*fixed_join-author*

Written and maintained by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>.

LICENSE						*fixed_join-license*

Licensed for distribution under the same terms as Vim itself (see |license|).

DISTRIBUTION					*fixed_join-distribution*

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and may eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves. See <https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/dotfiles.git/about/> for more
information.
