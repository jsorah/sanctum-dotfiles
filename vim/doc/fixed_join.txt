*fixed_join.txt*  Mapping to join lines in normal mode without moving cursor

This plugin provides a mapping target <Plug>FixedJoin to create a binding for a
user to join lines in normal mode without the cursor jumping around.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
