*fixed_join.txt*  Join lines in normal mode without moving cursor

This plugin provides a mapping target <Plug>FixedJoin to create a binding for a
user to join lines in normal mode without the cursor jumping around. If the
user's configuration does not specify a mapping to this target by the time this
plugin is loaded, it will attempt to map 'J' in normal mode to simply replace
the default functionality.

The plugin also provides a :FixedJoin command if you have +user_commands, but
this is not required.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
