*fixed_join.txt*	For Vim version 7.0	Last change: 2017 November 12

DESCRIPTION					*fixed_join*

This plugin provides a mapping target <Plug>FixedJoin to create a binding for a
user to `:join` lines in normal mode without the cursor jumping around. If the
user's configuration does not specify a mapping to this target by the time this
plugin is loaded, it will attempt to map 'J' in normal mode to simply replace
the default functionality.

The plugin also provides a `:FixedJoin` command if you have |+user_commands|, but
this is not required.

REQUIREMENTS					*fixed_join-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

AUTHOR						*fixed_join-author*

Written and maintained by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>.

LICENSE						*fixed_join-license*

Licensed for distribution under the same terms as Vim itself (see |license|).

DISTRIBUTION					*fixed_join-distribution*

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and may eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves. See <https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/dotfiles.git/about/> for more
information.
