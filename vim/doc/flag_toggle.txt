*flag_toggle.txt*  Functions to toggle single-character flags in options

This plugin provides functions flag_toggle#Toggle(option, flag) and
flag_toggle#ToggleLocal(option, flag) to toggle the values of options like
|'formatoptions'| or |'complete'| that have values comprised of
single-character flags. The author originally designed it for toggling flags in
|'formatoptions'| quickly.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
