*auto_undodir.txt*	For Vim version 7.0	Last change: 2017 November 12

DESCRIPTION					*auto_undodir*

This plugin attempts to create a directory "undo" in the directory named by
the first element of 'runtimepath', and enables 'undofile' with that as the
'undodir' if it succeeds or if the directory already exists.

It requires the |+persistent_undo| feature.

REQUIREMENTS					*auto_undodir-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

AUTHOR						*auto_undodir-author*

Written and maintained by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>.

LICENSE						*auto_undodir-license*

Licensed for distribution under the same terms as Vim itself (see |license|).

DISTRIBUTION					*auto_undodir-distribution*

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and may eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves. See <https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/dotfiles.git/about/> for more
information.
