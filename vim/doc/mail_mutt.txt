This plugin provides a :MailMutt command which accepts a range of lines
defaulting to the entire buffer, writing these lines to a temporary file that
is then provided to the -i option of the mutt(1) MUA as the initial content of
a new message.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
