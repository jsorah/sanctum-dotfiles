*mail_mutt.txt*	For Vim version 7.0	Last change: 2017 November 12

DESCRIPTION					*mail_mutt*

This plugin allows you to quickly start writing an email message in Mutt with
a range of lines from the current buffer as the initial mail content.

REQUIREMENTS					*mail_mutt-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

You will want to have the mutt(1) command from the Mutt distribution installed
to use this plugin. Mutt is available from <http://www.mutt.org/>.

COMMANDS					*mail_mutt-commands* *:MailMutt*

This plugin provides a single command `:MailMutt` command which accepts a line
range prefix defaulting to the entire buffer, writing these lines to a
temporary file that is then provided to the -i option of the Mutt mail user
agent, as the initial content of a new message.
>
	:MailMutt
	:.MailMutt
	:3,6MailMutt
	:95,$MailMutt

MAPPINGS					*mail_mutt-mappings*

Three <Plug> mapping targets are also provided for convenience. No attempt is
made to map key sequences to these mappings within the plugin; you must do
this explicitly in your |vimrc|.

CURRENT LINE					*MailMuttLine*

Th <Plug>MailMuttLine mapping runs `:MailMutt` on the current line in normal
mode. For example:
>
	:nmap <Leader>ml <Plug>MailMuttLine
<
WHOLE BUFFER					*MailMuttBuffer*

The <Plug>MailMuttBuffer mapping runs `:MailMutt` on the whole buffer in
normal mode. For example:
>
	:nmap <Leader>mb <Plug>MailMuttBuffer
<
SELECTED LINES					*MailMuttSelected*

The <Plug>MailMuttSelected mapping runs `:MailMutt` on the selected lines in
visual or selection mode. For example:
>
	:vmap <Leader>ms <Plug>MailMuttSelected
<

DISTRIBUTION					*mail_mutt-distribution*
