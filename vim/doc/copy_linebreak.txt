*copy_linebreak.txt*  Mapping to toggle copy-paste friendly linebreak options

This plugin provides a mapping target <Plug>CopyLinebreak to create a binding
for a user to quickly toggle |'linebreak'|-related settings when |'wrap'| is
enabled, to switch between human-readable output and a format friendly for
copy-pasting with terminal emulators or screen/tmux.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
