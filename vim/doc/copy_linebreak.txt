This plugin provides mapping targets for a user to set, unset, or toggle
|'linebreak'|-related settings when |'wrap'| is enabled, to switch between
human-readable output and a format friendly for copy-pasting with terminal
emulators or screen/tmux.

Mappings:

    <Plug>CopyLinebreakEnable
    <Plug>CopyLinebreakDisable
    <Plug>CopyLinebreakToggle

Commands:

    :CopyLinebreakEnable
    :CopyLinebreakDisable
    :CopyLinebreakToggle

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
