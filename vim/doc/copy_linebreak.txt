*copy_linebreak.txt*	For Vim version 7.0	Last change: 2017 November 12

DESCRIPTION					*copy_linebreak*

This plugin provides mapping targets for a user to set, unset, or toggle
|'linebreak'|-related settings when |'wrap'| is enabled, to switch between
human-readable output and a format friendly for copy-pasting with terminal
emulators or screen/tmux.

REQUIREMENTS					*copy_linebreak-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

MAPPINGS					*copy_linebreak-mappings*

Mapping targets provided are:

|<Plug>CopyLinebreakEnable|:			*<Plug>CopyLinebreakEnable*
    Enable copy-paste friendly line break options.
|<Plug>CopyLinebreakDisable|:			*<Plug>CopyLinebreakDisable*
    Revert to human-readable line break options.
|<Plug>CopyLinebreakToggle|:			*<Plug>CopyLinebreakToggle*
    Toggle between the above two states.

There are no default key mappings to any of these targers; you should define
them yourself in your |vimrc|. For example:
>
	:nmap <Leader>b <Plug>CopyLinebreakToggle
