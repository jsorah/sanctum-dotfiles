*detect_background.txt*  Figure out 'background' with a bias towards "dark"

This plugin inspects the $COLORFGBG environment variable to determine whether
the user is using a terminal with a light background. It reverses Vim's
built-in attempts to do this, which have the opposite default.

It does not inspect the value of the $TERM variable or |'term'| at all.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
