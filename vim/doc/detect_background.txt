*detect_background.txt*  Figure out 'background' with a bias towards "dark"

The detect_background#DetectBackground() function provided by this plugin
inspects the $COLORFGBG environment variable to determine whether the user is
using a terminal with a light background, and returns the word "dark" or
"light" accordingly, for use in setting 'background'.

The function does roughly the reverse of Vim's built-in heuristics to set the
'background' option, which default to a light background in the absence of
hints otherwise.

Note that this plugin does not inspect the value of the $TERM environment
variable or the |'term'| option at all, nor the |'t_RB'| option.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
