*detect_background.txt*	For Vim version 7.0	Last change: 2017 November 12

DESCRIPTION					*detect_background*

The |detect_background#DetectBackground()| function provided by this plugin
inspects the $COLORFGBG environment variable to determine whether the user is
using a terminal with a light background, and returns the word "dark" or
"light" accordingly, for use in setting 'background'.

The function does roughly the reverse of Vim's built-in heuristics to set the
'background' option, which default to a light background in the absence of
hints otherwise.

Note that this plugin does not inspect the value of the $TERM environment
variable or the |'term'| option at all, nor the |'t_RB'| option.

REQUIREMENTS					*detect_background-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

AUTHOR						*detect_background-author*

Written and maintained by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>.

LICENSE						*detect_background-license*

Licensed for distribution under the same terms as Vim itself (see |license|).

DISTRIBUTION					*detect_background-distribution*

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and may eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves. See <https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/dotfiles.git/about/> for more
information.
