*command_typos.txt*	For Vim version 7.0	Last change: 2017 November 12

DESCRIPTION					*command_typos*

This plugin defines custom commands like :W, :Qa, and :Wq to match their
lowercase analogues, to forgive me when my pinky finger doesn't roll off the
Shift key quite soon enough after pressing the colon key.

REQUIREMENTS					*command_typos-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

AUTHOR						*command_typos-author*

Written and maintained by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>.

LICENSE						*command_typos-license*

Licensed for distribution under the same terms as Vim itself (see |license|).

DISTRIBUTION					*command_typos-distribution*

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and may eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves. See <https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/dotfiles.git/about/> for more
information.
