*command_typos.txt*  Bind capital-letter versions of common commands

This plugin defines custom commands like :W, :Qa, and :Wq to match their
lowercase analogues, to forgive me when my pinky finger doesn't roll off the
Shift key quite soon enough after pressing the colon key.

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and will eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves.
