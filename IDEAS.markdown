Ideas
=====

*   I can probably share my psql() completions/shortcuts after sanitizing them
    a bit
*   sxhkd(1) might be nicer than xbindkeys; it's in Debian Testing now
*   Wouldn't be too hard to add some HTTP BASIC auth to ix(1df) to make pastes
    manageable
*   Have eds(1df) accept stdin with the "starting content" for the script
*   Convert all the manual pages to mandoc maybe? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandoc>
*   edio(1df), like vipe(1)
*   Maybe add ~/.mailrc
